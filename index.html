        <h1>Giant Panda</h1>

        <p>
            The giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca; Chinese: 大熊猫; pinyin: dàxióngmāo), also known as the panda bear or
            simply the <strong>panda</strong>, is a bear native to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Central_China">south central China</a>. It is characterised by
            large,
            black
            patches around
            its eyes, over the ears, and across its round body.

        <p>
            The name "giant panda" is sometimes used to distinguish it from
            the red panda, a neighboring musteloid.

        </p>

        <p>
            Though it belongs to the order Carnivora, the giant panda is a folivore,
            with bamboo shoots and leaves making up more than 99% of its diet.

        <p>
            Giant pandas in the wild will occasionally eat other grasses, wild tubers, or even meat in the form of
            birds,
            rodents, or carrion.
        </p>

        <p>
            In captivity, they may receive honey, eggs, fish, yams, shrub leaves, oranges, or bananas along with
            specially
            prepared food.

        <h1>Diet</h1>
        <p>
            Despite its taxonomic classification as a carnivoran, the giant panda's diet is primarily herbivorous,
            consisting almost exclusively of bamboo.[45] However, the giant panda still has the digestive system of a
            carnivore, as well as carnivore-specific genes,[49] and thus derives little energy and little protein from
            consumption of bamboo. Its ability to digest cellulose is ascribed to the microbes in its gut.[50][51]
            Pandas are born with sterile intestines and require bacteria obtained from their mother's feces to digest
            vegetation.[52] The giant panda is a highly specialised animal with unique adaptations, and has lived in
            bamboo forests for millions of yeeeeeeeaaaaaaars.[53]
